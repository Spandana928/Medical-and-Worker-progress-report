# 📄 Medical & Worker Progress Report – HTML/CSS/JS Assignment

## 🔧 Overview

This project recreates the layout, structure, and dynamic behavior of two official documents using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

1. **Medical & Travel Expense Request**
2. **Worker Progress Report**

The implementation ensures the content **visually matches the original PDFs**, while maintaining dynamic functionality (e.g., tables and form elements can handle variable input).
